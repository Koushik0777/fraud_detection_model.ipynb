# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Business Problem
Credit card fraud causes significant financial loss for banks and customers.
The objective of this project is to identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing missed fraud cases.

## Dataset
Publicly available anonymized credit card transaction dataset.
The data is highly imbalanced, reflecting real-world fraud scenarios.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Handling class imbalance
- Baseline Logistic Regression
- Tree-based models for comparison
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and recall-focused metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall (primary focus)
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Insights
- Accuracy is misleading for imbalanced datasets
- Recall is critical to avoid missing fraudulent transactions
- Threshold tuning helps balance business risk
